# klever-api

The Technical Challenge consists of creating an API with Golang using gRPC with stream pipes that exposes an upvote service endpoints.

**Technical requirements**:
- Keep the code in Github

**API**:
- The API must guarantee the typing of user inputs. If an input is expected as a string, it can only be received as a string.
- The structs used with your mongo model should support Marshal/Unmarshal with bson, json and struct
- The API should contain unit test of methods it uses

**Extra**:
- Deliver the whole solution running in some free cloud service
